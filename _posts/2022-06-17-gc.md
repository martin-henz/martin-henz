# A Virtual Machine with Garbage Collection

## In a nutshell

This post describes an implementations of machine and compiler. To play with it, click the link
[A virtual machine with garbage collection)](https://share.sourceacademy.org/jssx2).

## Motivation

The [last post](https://martin-henz.github.io/martin-henz/2022/06/06/heap.html)
presented a virtual machine with explicit memory management
to represent runtime entities such as
environments, function objects, and runtime-stack frames.
These entities were allocated from a *heap* data structure, which was an array
of primitive values. When a new entity is needed, it gets allocated a contiguous
range of heap slots called a *node* starting at a *free* pointer. After each allocation,
the *free* pointer gets incremented by the size of the allocated entity. That means
that the heap keeps growing bigger and bigger, as computation proceeds.

This regime may not be realistic, because it keeps allocating fresh memory for runtime
entities. In our JavaScript implementation of the previous post where automatically resizing
JavaScript arrays are used, the heap will grow very quickly. In programming languages that
have a fixed array size, such as C, the implementer of the machine is faced with the question
how big the heap should be to accommodate all runtime entities. In both cases, there is
typically a lot of wasted memory: At any point of time, there are bound to be many nodes that
will never be used again, and yet the machine will keep their slots prereserved forever. Such
nodes are called *garbage*. Unfortunately, we cannot predict precisely which nodes are
garbage. As usual, we take a conservative approach and define a safe approximation.

## Preparing the heap

A useful property of the machine is that it will only visit nodes in the heap by following
pointers from a small number of *registers*. These are the current environment, the current
operand stack, and the current frames on the runtime stack. These nodes are called *roots*.
The nodes reachable from the roots are called *live*, and the rest is called *dead*.
Any dead node is garbage, and therefore its memory can be reused.
In this post, I describe a memory management technique called *stop-and-copy* that makes
use of this property. The first idea is to split the available memory in two halves.
``` js
onst heap = [];
const heap_size = 100000;
const heap_bottom = 0;
const space_size = heap_size / 2 ;
```
The machine keeps allocating
memory from one half of the memory, and when that half is full, it stops execution of machine
instructions, copies all live nodes into the other half, and then resumes execution.
``` js
let to_space = heap_bottom;
let top_of_space = to_space + space_size - 1; 
let from_space = top_of_space + 1;
let free = to_space;
```
Initially, the bottom half of the memory is called the `to_space` and the top half is
called the `from_space`. 
The new version of the function `make_node` keeps allocating memory from the current `to_space`.
``` js
function make_node(kind, size) {
    if (free + size > top_of_space) {
        flip();
    }
    if (free + size /* still */ > top_of_space) {
        error("out of memory");
    } else {
        const node_address = free;
        heap[node_address + kind_offset] = kind;
        heap[node_address + size_offset] = size;
        heap[node_address + number_of_children_offset] = 0;
        free = free + size;
        return node_address;
    }
}
```
The function `flip` reverses the roles of `from_space` and `to_space`, and copies all
nodes reachable from the roots (environment, operand stack, and runtime-stack frames).
``` js
function flip() {
    let temp = from_space;
    from_space =to_space; 
    to_space = temp; 
    top_of_space = to_space + space_size - 1; 
    let scan = to_space; 
    free = to_space;
    environment = copy(environment);
    operand_stack = copy(operand_stack);
    for (let r = runtime_stack; !is_null(r); r = tail(r)) {
         set_head(r, copy(head(r)));
    }
    while (scan < free ) {
        let number_of_children = heap[scan + number_of_children_offset];
        for (let c = 0; c < number_of_children; c = c + 1) {
            heap[scan + first_child_offset + c] = 
                copy(heap[scan + first_child_offset + c]);
        }
        scan = scan + heap[scan + size_offset];
    }
}
```
After all roots are copied into the to-space, a while loop scans
the copied nodes and copies their children as well. A `scan` pointer
keeps track of the next copy whose children still need to be copied.
A `free` pointer keeps track of the place where the next child is to
be copied to. The copying of children
continues until `scan` reaches `free`, at
which point all live nodes have been copied from the from-space
to the to-space. This particularly elegant way of copying all
live nodes in a breadth-first manner using a while-loop is due to
[C.J. Cheney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheney%27s_algorithm).

Each time a node is copied using the `copy` function, the address
of the copy is recorded in the original. This address is traditionally
called a "broken heart".
``` js
const broken_heart_offset = 0; // use kind slot for broken heart
function copy(v) {
    if (already_copied(v)) {
        return heap[v + broken_heart_offset];
    } else {
        const addr = free;
        move(v, free);
        free = free + heap[v + size_offset];
        heap[v + broken_heart_offset] = addr; 
        return addr;
    }
}
```
The `copy` function checks if a node is already copied to the
to-space using
the broken-heart address.
``` js
function already_copied(v) {
    return heap[v + broken_heart_offset] >= to_space &&
           heap[v + broken_heart_offset] <= top_of_space;
}
```
The actual copying is done using the `move` function.
``` js
function move(from, to) {
    let size = heap[from + size_offset];
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i = i + 1) {
        heap[to + i] = heap[from + i];
    }
}
```

## Nasty bugs

The integration of a stop-and-copy garbage collector into a virtual
machine is notoriously error-prone. I'm going to illustrate
this judgment using the call-instruction as an example. Take a look
at this seemingly reasonable implementation of the call-instruction.
``` js
        // machine clause for call-instruction
        } else if (is_call_instruction(instr)) {
            const arity = call_instruction_arity(instr);
            const callee = peek_in_operand_stack(arity);
            if (is_primitive_function(callee)) {
                const args = pop_arguments_from_operand_stack(arity);
                const callee = pop_from_operand_stack();
                pc = pc + 1;
                push_on_operand_stack(apply_primitive_function(
                                          callee,
                                          args));
            } else {
                runtime_stack = pair(make_runtime_stack_call_frame(),
                                     runtime_stack);
                const max_stack_size = function_max_stack_size(callee);
                pc = function_address(callee);
                environment = function_environment(callee);
                extend_environment(arity);
                operand_stack = make_operand_stack(max_stack_size);
            }
        } else ...
```
If the callee is a compound function, the machine allocates a new
runtime-stack frame on the heap and pushes it on the runtime stack.
It sets the `pc` to the first instruction of the function
body and allocates a new environment node on the heap
using the `extend_environment` function, which assigns the
`environment` register to the new node. Finally, it
allocates a new operand stack of sufficient size on the heap
and assigns the `operand_stack` register to it.

But note that each heap allocation can trigger a garbage collection,
which renders previously obtained addresses obsolete. The bug
in the implementation above is that a garbage collection triggered
by `make_runtime_stack_call_frame` renders the `callee` address
obsolete. In that case, the `environment` register gets assigned
to an obsolete address in the from-space, whose node might
get overwritten in the next call of `flip` before it is used
by some other instruction.

To fix the bug, I'm reobtaining the callee address after the
call of `make_runtime_stack_call_frame`.
``` js
        // machine clause for call-instruction
        } else if (is_call_instruction(instr)) {
            const arity = call_instruction_arity(instr);
            const callee = peek_in_operand_stack(arity);
            if (is_primitive_function(callee)) {
                const args = pop_arguments_from_operand_stack(arity);
                const callee = pop_from_operand_stack();
                pc = pc + 1;
                push_on_operand_stack(apply_primitive_function(
                                          callee,
                                          args));
            } else {
                runtime_stack = pair(make_runtime_stack_call_frame(),
                                     runtime_stack);
                // callee might be obsolete; reload from current operand stack
                const callee = peek_in_operand_stack(arity);
                const max_stack_size = function_max_stack_size(callee);
                pc = function_address(callee);
                environment = function_environment(callee);
                extend_environment(arity);
                operand_stack = make_operand_stack(max_stack_size);
            }
        } else ...
```
A few further modifications are needed to avoid
obsolete addresses in the machine. As another example, each operation
on the operand stack now uses the `operand_stack` register just before
it is needed, instead of passing a possibly obsolete heap address
as argument to the operation.
``` js
function push_on_operand_stack(v) {
    heap[operand_stack + first_child_offset +
         heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset]] = v;
    heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset] = 
        heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset] + 1;
}
function pop_from_operand_stack() {
    const val = heap[operand_stack + first_child_offset - 1 +
                     heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset]];
    heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset] = 
        heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset] - 1;
    return val;
}
function top_of_operand_stack() {
    return heap[operand_stack + first_child_offset - 1 + 
                heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset]];
}
function peek_in_operand_stack(n) {
    return heap[operand_stack + first_child_offset - 1 + 
                heap[operand_stack + number_of_children_offset] - n];
}
```
Play with
[the machine implementation](https://share.sourceacademy.org/jssx2)
by changing `heap_size`. If it is large enough, the machine
code runs to the end without a single garbage collection. As
you make `heap_size` smaller and smaller, more and more
garbage collections are needed. Add `display` messages
to keep track of the calls of `flip`. If `heap_size` becomes
too small, `flip` cannot free a sufficient amount of space
for the next node, and the program terminates with the message
`memory exhausted`.

## Summary

This post concludes my coverage of virtual machines in this blog.
I started out with a rather high-level machine that used
a global operand stack and the environment data structure
from SICP JS. I replaced the global operand stack by
local operand stacks of precomputed size that are allocated
for each function call.
I replaced the SICP-JS-style environments by arrays by
exploiting the properties of lexical scoping. These
changes allowed me to allocate all runtime entities
on a heap data structure. Finally in this post,
I introduced garbage collection as a method to reuse
the space of heap nodes that are no longer needed.

If you like to take this a bit further, here are a couple of
ideas:

**Byte code**: Represent the machine code by sequences of
bytes (or JavaScript numbers). The machine can then dispatch
using the first byte (number) of the sequence, instead of
using nested conditionals as in the machines shown so far.

**Representing primitive values**: Investigate how to
optimize the treatment of primitive values (numbers, boolean
values) to avoid heap allocation.

**Representing strings**: Investigate how strings can be
handled in the machine, after reading about a *string pool* in
[SICP JS 5.5.6](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/5.5.6).
